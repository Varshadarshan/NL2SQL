# NL2SQL
Project Overview

This project enables users to query a PostgreSQL database using plain English instead of writing SQL.
It leverages a Large Language Model (LLaMA 3.1 via Groq) with prompt engineering to convert natural language business questions into safe, executable SQL queries, execute them on a normalized relational database, and return analytical results.

The system is designed for data analysts and business users to perform self-service analytics without deep SQL expertise.

Problem Statement

Business users often rely on data teams to write SQL queries for basic analytical questions, creating delays and bottlenecks.
This project solves that problem by allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive accurate results directly from the database.

Key Features

Natural Language → SQL conversion using LLM (Groq – LLaMA 3.1)

PostgreSQL integration with normalized schema

Schema-aware and JOIN-aware SQL generation

Prompt-engineered SQL safety (SELECT-only, schema-restricted)

End-to-end analytics workflow in Jupyter Notebook

Supports aggregations, filters, joins, and sorting


Dataset

Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)

~9,994 records

Cleaned and preprocessed before loading into PostgreSQL


Database Schema (Normalized)
customers

customer_id PRIMARY KEY,

customer_name,

segment,

country,

city,

state,

region


orders

order_id,

order_date,

ship_date,

customer_id,

product_id,

sales,

quantity,

discount,

profit


products

product_id PRIMARY KEY,

category,

sub_category,

product_name

Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nl2sql-superstore.git
cd nl2sql-superstore


Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure Environment Variables

Create a env.txt file:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

DB_HOST=localhost

DB_PORT=5432

DB_NAME=superstore

DB_USER=postgres

DB_PASSWORD=password



Prompt Engineering Strategy

Hard-coded database schema in system prompt

Enforced rules:

Only SELECT queries allowed

Only predefined tables and columns

Proper JOIN usage required

No explanations or markdown in output



Use Cases

Self-service analytics for business users

Rapid data exploration by analysts

AI-assisted business intelligence

SQL automation and analytics acceleration




🔮 Future Enhancements

Streamlit or web-based UI

Data visualizations (charts & dashboards)

Query history and logging

Multi-database support

This ensures accuracy, safety, and reliability.



This project demonstrates SQL expertise, data modeling, analytics thinking, and LLM integration
